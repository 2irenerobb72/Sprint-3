1. Again, this book and this chapter are very similar to the Psychology
class I took in school. I did a unit on mindfulness and meditation.
In my class we actually did 45 minutes of meditation to see what it was like.
Some people actually fell asleep. I like the idea of meditation but it's hard
to actually get around to doing it. I really like what he said about doing
meditation in short bursts if it is starting to feel like a chore. I think
I might try that!
2. Is it possible? YES! How could we not empathetic to one another even though
we are in different countries and so far away when we are connected
through the Internet. Since empathy is already in our genes and everything
still evolves. This is idea that people can be connected as a whole through
empathy can evolve too. The world is already working toward the goal.
the example in the video with the earthquake in Haiti, I'm very sure many
people around the world, no matter what country felt for them. I remember
my school had a fundraiser called Hope For Haiti where they sold ribbons.
Some conflicts that are occurring in the world that could possibly stop
this global empathy from happening is war, including the threat of war. I
think that this is something worth my time because if another country had
a natural disaster I would be inclined to help for example raising money and
awareness. I don't see any downsides of pursuing it. But the downsides of
not is guilt.
3. I tried to sit up as straight as possible every time I remembered to but
I kept forgetting to do it. So I can't really prove that it helped with
my mental state. But from some of the articles I've read about posture being
good for you and you're mind I'm sure it has worked on some people.
