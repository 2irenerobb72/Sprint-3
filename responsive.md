The key features include the size changing depending of the screen,
same code for all devices and the page elements reshuffle.
To have one HTML code for all instead of individual web apps is that the
development is faster. Who doesn't want the development to be faster,
that sold me right there. So my opinion is Responsive apps over native.
The faster and more efficient I can do my work the better.
