The users of this site will get a easy to use site that will help girls clean
out their closets. Being a young adult girl and while I was in high school
I had so many clothes that I don't use that I payed a good amount for. I want
to make a website that will help people sell their clothes to get some of their
money back.

As for a brand, I think maybe give the top sellers get boxes or a bags in a crazy
color like pink, and send them to the person.
Having a catchy name, I've been thinking about making this website for years,
I want it to be something like 'The Bean' or 'The clothes line'
