I learned that their was refreshable braille devices that converts text
into braille. I think that is so cool! I do agree with it, since perception
is such a big part of the viewers experience. I think web developers
should do everything they can to make it easier for people who have a
disability that will make it harder for them to use the Internet. In the
future I definitely think having certain colors for links that will be easier
for people who have low vision or color blindness.
